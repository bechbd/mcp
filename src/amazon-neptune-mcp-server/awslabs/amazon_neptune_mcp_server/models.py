"""Data Models Module for Neptune Graph Database.

This module defines the core data structures and types used throughout the Neptune
graph database interface. It includes models for query languages, graph schema
definitions, and knowledge graph components.

The models use Python's dataclass decorator for clean, type-safe data structures
that represent both the graph structure and its contents.
